# Integrate Opentitan AES module to Vexiiriscv MicroSoc

This project aims to integrate the AES hardware IP from the OpenTitan project into the RISC-V-based MicroSoC from the VexRiscv project.

The following steps should be followed to generate a bitstream for the project.

The project can be created by simply running the TCL script located at /Vexiiriscv-AES/Vexii-AES-Vivado-Project/default-vivado/MicroSoc-AES.tcl. This script includes all the modifications described in this README and in the AES_module_integration_with_MicroSoc.pdf document, and generates a Vivado project ready for partial reconfiguration. For better understanding and future modifications, the detailed steps are also provided below.

# Clone VEXIIRISCV-AES Repository

The first step is to clone the VexRiscv repository.
Since both the hardware (e.g. peripheral integration) and software are actively maintained and updated, it's important to regularly pull the latest changes 

https://github.com/zaskill/Vexiiriscv-AES.git 

# Clone Opentitan Repository 

It is necessary to clone the opentitan repository to get the necessary files for the AES HW IP.
It is recommended to clone this repository outside the VEXIIRISCV-AES folder.

https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan.git

# Opentitan AES IP extraction

Fusesoc is used to extract the necessary RTL files for the AES IP.
Doing this manually is quite challenging, as the AES IP has many dependencies â€” totaling around 230 files.
Without Fusesoc, correctly resolving these dependencies and file order would be error-prone and time-consuming.

To use the AES IP from OpenTitan, start by cloning the OpenTitan repository from https://github.com/lowRISC/opentitan.git. 

If fusesoc is not already installed, it can be installed using pip install fusesoc. Once installed, you can explore available AES-related IPs by running fusesoc list-cores | grep aes. 

The IP core relevant for integration is aes_wrap, which serves as a top-level wrapper around the AES module. It includes a finite state machine (FSM) to handle TileLink communication. The I/O interface of this wrapper exposes only the key and the encrypted/decrypted data, making it suitable for direct integration into SoC environments.

# Aes_wrap.sv file

-Introduction of a start Signal:
A new input signal, start, was added to explicitly trigger the FSM from software after input data is loaded. This ensures precise initiation of the AES operation.

-Rising Edge Detection on start:
To avoid multiple unintended FSM cycles due to slow deassertion of the start signal, a one-cycle pulse (start_pulse) was generated using edge detection logic (start_r and start_r_prev).

-Latched Start Control:
A flag start_latched was introduced to retain the start condition once asserted. Initially, the start pulse lasted only one clock cycle, which was too short to be reliably detected when the FSM was in the IDLE state, causing it to be missed. By latching the signal, it remains asserted throughout the entire duration of the IDLE state, ensuring the FSM consistently detects the trigger and initiates exactly one AES operation per request.

-Extended Mode Support (CTR, CBC):
Inputs aes_iv (initialization vector) and aes_decrypt_i (decryption mode selector) were introduced, allowing the wrapper to support modes beyond ECB, such as CTR.

-IV Handling in FSM:
The FSM was updated to properly load the initialization vector (IV) data into the AES core when required by the selected mode. In the original implementation, the IV was hardcoded to zero and not even connected as an input to the aes_wrap module, effectively causing it to be ignored. The modifications ensure that valid IV data is now provided to the core as needed.

-Improved FSM Restart Behavior:
The FSM now returns to the IDLE state after completing an operation instead of staying in FINISH. This change enables repeated AES operations without requiring a reset. The FSM only restarts when a new input is received, as explained with the start protocol earlier, ensuring one operation per distinct trigger.

-Data Valid Output Signal:
A new output, data_valid, was introduced to indicate when a valid AES output is available. This signal is critical for ensuring proper synchronization with downstream modules, such as the input of the FIFO, which uses it to enable writing only when the AES output is fully processed. Without this mechanism, the same data could be written multiple times, potentially corrupting the configuration when interfacing with components like ICAP.

-Debugging Support (Optional):
An ILA instance (ila_3) was temporarily added for debugging internal FSM signals like data_valid, start_pulse, and state transitions.

--The aes_wrap.sv file must be modified from its original version, as the I/O interface differs in the newer implementation !

# Builduing Software

To build software, this command can be used to compile the cpp files, all the Makefiles are already configured for the desired compilation.

cd Vexiifirmware
rm -rf build && cmake -S . -B build -DSOC=microsoc/default -DDEVICE=microsoc_sim &&  make -C build example-aes

# Building Hardware (Microsoc SOC)

The Microsoc Soc is based on a Vexiiriscv RISCV processor with some basic peripherals (UART, RAM ...). 
This SoC was modified in this project, and AES module from the Opentitan project was added as a peripheral, the vexiiriscv cpu can control the IP.

The github of the original project : https://github.com/SpinalHDL/VexiiRiscv.git

To build hardware, this command can be used to compile the scala files. 

sbt "runMain vexiiriscv.soc.micro.MicroSocGen \
  --ram-bytes 16384 \
  --ram-elf "PATH_TO_REPO/Vexiiriscv-AES/VexiiFirmware/build/app/aes/example-aes.elf" \
  --demo-peripheral leds=8,buttons=4 \
  --xlen 32 \
  --with-mul \
  --with-div \
  --with-rvm \
  --system-frequency 100000000 \
  --jtag-tap true \
  --jtag-instruction true \
  --reset-vector 0x80000000 \
  --with-supervisor"

Then the aes_wrap project generated with fusesoc should be opened and the following files located in Rtl_files should be added :
-aes_wrap.sv (should replace the original)
-prim_alert_sender.sv (should replace the original)
-top_microsoc.sv
-fifo128to32.v

After running the command above two files are generated and should be added to the project :

-MicroSoc.v
-soc.h

# Partial reconfiguration

To enable partial reconfiguration and bitstream generation, a document FPGA_partial_configuration_using_ICAP.pdf located in document folder can be helpful to enable reconfiguration and generate a partial bitstream for the desired design.
